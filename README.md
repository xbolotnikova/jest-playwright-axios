## Test tasks for JS (Jest + Playwright + Axios) ##

### How to run tests ###
For this task I used Linux (Ubuntu) and IntellijIdea IDE combination.

* Fetch the code from the repository
* Switch to the project directory
* Use the `npm install` command
* To run tests use the `jest task1` or `jest task2` command
